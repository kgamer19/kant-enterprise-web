      <h1 className="h1">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="p">
        Kant Enterprises Co., Ltd. ("KE") is committed to safeguarding the confidential
         information provided to them by their clients, investors and prospective and 
         former clients and investors (referred to for purposes of this policy together as “Investors”).
          This notice provides information about the privacy policies and practices of KE.

KE collects nonpublic personal information about Investors from the following sources:
 interviews and other conversations between Investors and representatives of KE and the
  Funds; subscription agreements, offering questionnaires and other documents provided by 
  Investors; information about Investors’ transactions and others; and information that 
  KE receives from consumer reporting agencies.

KE does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about any of their Investors
 to anyone, except as permitted by law. Disclosures that are permitted by law include 
 disclosures that are necessary to effect, administer or enforce a transaction that an
  Investor requests or authorizes. Other examples of disclosures that are permitted by 
  law are disclosures to accountants, auditors and lawyers, disclosures to regulators 
  that examine KE's business, disclosures that Investors specifically request and 
  disclosures authorized by an Investor in its subscription agreement.

KE does not provide personal information about Investors to mailing list vendors or 
solicitors for any purpose. KE restricts access to nonpublic personal information 
about Investors to those employees of KE who have a business or professional need to 
know such information. In addition, KE uses reasonable precautions to maintain a secure 
office and computer environment to ensure that the confidentiality of Investors’ information 
is not placed at unreasonable risk.

NOTE: This Privacy Policy is solely for informational purposes and is subject to change, 
completion, or amendment without notice. It does not constitute an offer to sell or the 
solicitation of an offer to buy.
